In this project, we'll create a sleek and modern random quote generator using JavaScript. With a glass morphism design, the website will display a title and a quote with the author's name. We'll be using an API to generate these random quotes, and we'll also learn how to create loading effects using try and catch methods and asynchronous functions. Additionally, we'll discover how to use CSS to create the glassy morphism design. The end result will be a visually appealing and functional quote generator that is easy to use and update.
